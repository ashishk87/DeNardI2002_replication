    In secion 4 of the paper, the author mentions the following:

    "To be consistent across experiments, I use the same initial distribution of productivity for 20 yr old workers in all simulations.
     To do so, I compute the initial aggregate distribution of productivity implied by the experiment with inheritance of productivity 
     and use it to initialize all the 20-year-old workers in the simulations without productivity inheritance"

    invher is the initial aggregate distribution of productivity implied by the experiment with inheritance of productivity.
    - With productivity inheritance we use invher and Qy to get to the stationary distribution of productivity at age 40 (inv40 = Qy*Qy*Qy*Qy*invher).
      And then use inv40 and Qyh to get the joint distribution of parents productivity at 40 and kids productivity at 20 (jt4020).
    
    - Without productivity inheritance, we start with invher and use (Qy)⁴  to get the joint distribution of parents productivity at 40 and kids productivity at 20 (jt4020),
       rather than using inv40 and Qyh.

    Now we fill the transition matrix (M) for the retirees:
    - M is a sparse matrix with the following structure:
    - rowindex of the transition matrix is given by rowM[counter]
    - colindex of the transition matrix is given by colM[counter]
    - value of the transition matrix is given by valM[counter]
    - counter track the states. Since optimal savings can lie between two grid points, we need to keep track of the weights assigned to the left grid point next to the optimal savings choice. So, for any given state s to any other state s', there will be two counter values attached to this one transition coz of the two grid points involved.

    here counter is is the unique identifier of each cell in the transition matrix
    =#
    
    #=
    We begin by specifying the nonzero elements in the transition matrix.
    And that is nonzeroM. Logic?

    Take the first component (da*dy*dy*3)*(dy).
    - da*dy*dy*3: total no. of states for working people when young and parents definitely survive next period. ∴ (#age)*(#productivity)*(#parents productivity)*(#asset)
    - Next period agents productivity can change, and so there are dy possible states for the next period's productivity.
    - Agents assets next period are determined by optimal policy, so it can transition to only one specific asset state.
    - Agent gets older by 1 year, so his age transitions to a deterministic next period age.
    - Since agent forms expectations of bequests based on parents productivity at age 40 which remains same even next period.
    - So, in total there are dy possible transition from any of the da*dy*dy*3 current states. 
    - Therefore, there are da*dy*dy*3*dy nonzero elements for the young working people when parents definitely survive next period.

    Similarly other components of the nonzeroM can be interpreted.

    nonzeroM =  (da*dy*dy*3)*(dy*2)+(da*dy*dy)*(dy*2+dy*da)+

    Now we solve the value function and policy function for the working people (continuing the backward induction)
    And fill the part of the transition matrix for the working people.

    Some important points:
    - Working people can only receive bequests after they turn 40 so they form expectations of bequests and inheritance. So, we'll have to keep track of the entire bequest distribution.
    - Also the budget constraint of the govt. needs to be satisfied. So, adjust τ_l until it does.
    =#

    # τ_l = 0.19671993190545248 # initial guess for labor income tax rate
    # τ_l = 0.2823769  # initial guess for labor income tax rate
    τ_l = 0.224  # initial guess for labor income tax rate
    relax = 0.7 # relaxation parameter for updating τ_l
    ϵ₂ = 1.0 # tolerance for govt. budget constraint
    # # counter for the nonzero elements in the transition matrix.
    # counter = Ref(4*da + 1)

    while ϵ₂ > 1e-4 # loop until govt. budget constraint is satisfied
        counterbeq = 1.0

        # Iterating over bequest distribution
        ϵ₁ = 1.0 # tolerance for convergence of bequest distribution

        while (ϵ₁ > 1e-4) # loop until convergence of bequest distribution
            iter = 1
            # Store the hours, minutes and seconds before the iteration in a log file
            current_time = Time(now())
            # Extract hour, minute, and second
            IHOUR = hour(current_time)
            IMIN = minute(current_time)
            ISEC = second(current_time)

            First we compute the value and policy function of all workers and then we will compute the transition matrix for the working people.
            We divide this task in cases.


            Case-1: Workers age TL (i.e. age 60). They are going to retire next period.
                    Currently the state space is ( parents productivity, own productivity, cash at hand).
                    Within this case there are two sub-cases.

                Case-1.1: Workers who have already inherited
                    - They have already received bequests so don't track beq dist. anymore
                
                Case-1.2: Workers who did not inherit so far but will definitely inherit next period
                    - This case requires tracking the bequest distribution

            The following function updates the value function, policy function for this case.

            Now moving to next case:

            Case-2: Workers aged 55 to 35.
                - They receive income shock next period, so far that was not the case
                - They can inherit next period

            Case-3: Workers aged 20 to 30.
                - They receive income shocks
                - They cannot inherit next period
                - And they cannot die next period, so they do not leave bequests next period

            #=
            Computed the value function and policy function for all workers. Now we need to update the transition matrix for the working people.

            Important points to note: Agents die and born each period, so rows of the transition matrix do not sum to 1 (people that die disappear from the system, and at each period a new cohort is born).
            The people's distribution over the state variables evolve accoding to:
            nₜ₊₁ = nₜ'M + qₜ₊₁ , where nₜ is the distribution of people over the state variables at time t and qₜ₊₁ is the distribution of newborns at time t+1.

            How is matrix M structured?
             - 1st variable: Agent's age
             - 2nd variable: Parent's productivity
             - 3rd variable: Agent's productivity
             - 4th variable: Agent's assets

            Before retirement, all four constitute the state space. After retirement, only age and assets constitute the state space coz they don't work and ca't inherit anymore.

            We filled in the transition matrix for the retirees and the oldies who are going to die for sure next period. Now we fill in the transition matrix for the working people now.

            DeNardi(2002) assumes that children observes parents productivity at age 40 before enetering job market (i.e. at age 15).
            Therefore, the ebquest distribution will be conditional on the parents productivity at age 40: beqdist(a |yp40, t).
            To construct this object, we go through several steps:

            Step-1: Find the distribution of assets at 40 yrs of age (Since we are dealing with stationary distribution, we can use the invariant distribution of assets at 40 yrs of age.)
                    Note that the above distrution will depend on parents productivity as well as their parents productivity (kid's grandparents) at age 40.

            Step-1 Contd: Construct joint distribution of agents parents income at 40, and agents assets at 40 conditional on his income at 40.

                          where:
                          P(y = yᵢ) = ∑ⱼₖ P(yp = ypⱼ, a = aₖ, y = yᵢ)

            Step-2: Next we construct the conditional distribution of characterstics of agents at 40 conditional on their income- m(a, y40, yp40|y40)
                    Coz that is what kids use to form expectations of bequest distribution. And we iterate that object forward in time using the
                    transition matrix M, i.e. m(a', y45, yp40|y40) = m(a, y40, yp40|y40)*M
                                              m(a'', y50, yp40|y40) = m(a', y45, yp40|y40)*M and so on.

            Now having constructed the conditional parents characterstics at age 40-m(a, y40, yp40|y40), we will use this object
            along with transition matrix to construct bequest distribution. Intuitively, we are just going to take dot product of 
            this period state with corresponding entry from transition matrix to obtain next period same distribution. And we will 
            continue to do it until we reach age 60 and beyond coz parents leave bequests after crossing age 60 (coz of mortality risk 
            they can leave bequest anytime after that).

            So, now we have updated the conditional distribution of parents characterstics m(a, y40, yp40|y40) upto age 60.
            That's what previous block of the code was all about. Now we iterate this distribution one step ahead, i.e. when agents attain age 65.
            So, like the above block we consider two cases:
              (i) working that have already inherited
              (ii) people that have not yet inherited (but will inherit next period since everyone receive bequests by the time they retire)
